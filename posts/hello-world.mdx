# Hello, world!

Finally Type-C Website is up and running! It took me a while but mainly due to "high standard" so to speak.
If Type-C is my creation, I wanted to shape and entire website to align very well with my vision and esthetics. I hope you like it!

This website is powered by `nextjs`, and the awesome `daisyui` and `tailwindcss`. 

Documentation and this blog are static `mdx` pages, each hosted on their own seprate repo for ease of maintenance and deployment. This was heavily inspired by `nextra`, 
which was the first template I used to start this project. Until I decided to go full custom.

The current state of Type-C at the time of writing is the following:

1. VM is being redesigned with some new changes I have implemented reguarding concurrency
2. Compiler frontend is almost complete, also needs changing for the code generator to adjust to the new VM design
3. VM Garbage Collector is being implemented and getting tested

It will take a while before Type-C is stable and ready for production, as both the compiler and the VM will need to be thouroughly tested,
this also takes into the account the lack JIT compiler, which is a must to have feature for Type-C
