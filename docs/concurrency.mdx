# Type-C Concurrency Model

Type-C concurrency, if it is a thread or process, is handeled entirely by the virtual machine. Each instance of a running process or thread is known as `core` in the virtual machine. There always one master core, which is the main execution thread of the virtual machine. 
Any core can create more cores, but there is no parent-child relationship between them. A core responds to whicher core created it, unless explicitely returned (as a return value from thread for example).

## Type-V Concurrency Internals
Internally, there are at least two threads, one main thread for running the VM engine, and the second is a `libuv` event loop thread.

The VM engine thread is responsible for scheduling and running cores. It is only updated through the libuv event loop thread. The libuv event loop thread is responsible for handling I/O operations, promises, timers and so on.
