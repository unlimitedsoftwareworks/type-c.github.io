# Type Joins
Type join is an operation to help reduce the necessaity to create new types. It is a way to combine multiple types into a single type. Only interface datatypes can joined together. Resuting in a new type combining the methods of both. When comparing actual values with a type join, the values must have a data type that represents a class that implements all of the interfaces in the type join. A type join is declared using the `&` operator. Here is an example:
```tc
type Movable = interface {
    move(x: u32, y: u32) -> void
}

type Drawable = interface {
    draw() -> void
}

type Draggable = interface {
    drag(x: u32, y: u32) -> void
}

type Square = class Movable, Drawable {
    move(x: u32, y: u32) -> void {
        // move the square
    }

    draw() {
        // draw the square
    }
}

let x: Square = new Square()

let y: Movable & Drawable = x // OK!
let z: Drawable & Movable = x // OK!
let a: Draggable & Drawable = x // Error! Square does not implement Draggable
```

Notice: Nullables cannot be joined with interfaces. This is because nullables are not interfaces. They are a special type of data type. However, a join type can be nullable. Here is an example:
```tc
type Movable = interface {
    move(x: u32, y: u32) -> void
}

type Drawable = interface {
    draw() -> void
}

type Draggable = interface {
    drag(x: u32, y: u32) -> void
}

let x: (Movable & Drawable)? = null
```

Please also note that at its core, a join type is an interface type. Hence, no duplicate methods are allowed.
