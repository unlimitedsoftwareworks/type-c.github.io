# Arrays

Types-C comes with built-in arrays types. This type is a primitive type and not to be confused with standard library `Array` type.

Similar to Java's arrays, Type-C arrays have fixed size and zero-based indexing. Arrays are declared using the `[]` syntax, and can be initialized using the `array` keyword.

```tc
let arr: u32[] = [1, 2, 3]
```

Arrays can be indexed using the `[]` operator, and their length can be obtained using the `length` property.

```tc
let arr: u32[] = [1, 2, 3]
let x = arr[0] // x = 1
let y = arr.length // y = 3
```

## Array operations:
Arrays can be indexed, extended or sliced, here the full list of operations:

```tc
let arr: u32[] = [1, 2, 3]
let x = arr[0] // x = 1
let y = arr.length // y = 3
arr[1] = 5 // arr = [1, 5, 3]
let z = arr.slice(0, 1)
z.extend(5)
```

- Indexing: `arr[i]`, `i` must be of type `u64`, returns the element at index `i`
- Index set: `arr[i] = x`, `i` must be of type `u64`, sets the element at index `i` to `x`, returns `arr[i]`.
- Length: `arr.length`, returns `u64`.
- Slice: `arr.slice(start, end)`, `start` and `end` must be of type `u64`.
- Extend: `arr.extend(x)`, `x` must be of type `u64`, sets the size of the array to `x`. Returns `void`.
