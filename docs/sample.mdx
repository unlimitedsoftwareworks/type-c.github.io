# Type-C Basics

In this chapter, we introduce the basics of Type-C, such as identifiers,
keywords, literals, program structure, etc. Some of the things we go
through here are more in-depth as others, this is for simplicity reasons
as things such as datatypes also have a chapter dedicated to them.

Cools, let's get started!

```tc

let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = x + y;
```
