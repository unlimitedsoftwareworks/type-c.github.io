# Type-C Design and Philosophy

## Introduction
Type-C's goal is productivity and safety. It is designed to be a language that is easy to learn and use, while still being powerful enough to be used in production. Type-C is a statically typed language, which means that it is designed to catch errors at compile time, rather than at runtime. This makes it easier to write correct code, and reduces the need for extensive testing. Type-C is also designed to be a general purpose language, which means that it can be used for a wide variety of applications.

## Design Principles
To say Type-C is small or simple language can be wrong. The language has a richset of features and designed to be expressive.

## Interface Oriented Programming
Instead of focusing on classes, Type-C focuses on interfaces. Interfaces are a powerful tool for abstraction, and are used extensively in Type-C. Interfaces are used to define the behavior of an object, separate of its implementation. This allows for a high degree of code reuse, and makes it easier to write generic code.
