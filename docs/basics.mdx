# Type-C Basics

In this chapter, we introduce the basics of Type-C, such as identifiers,
keywords, literals, program structure, etc. Some of the things we go
through here are more in-depth as others, this is for simplicity reasons
as things such as datatypes also have a chapter dedicated to them.

## Identifiers

Identifiers in Type-C serve as names for variables, functions, types,
and other entities. An identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, and
underscores, starting with a letter or an underscore. Here are the exact
rules of variable names:
-   Must start with a letter (either uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (\_).
-   Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
-   Cannot contain special characters like `#, \$, %, etc`.
-   Cannot be a reserved keyword.
-   Are case-sensitive; for example, `myVariable` and `myvariable` are
distinct identifiers.

-   Follows the following regular expression pattern:
`^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`


**Examples of Valid Identifiers:**

```tc
let myVar = 10
let _temp = "temporary"
let SomeValue = true
let PI_value = 3.14159
```

**Examples of Invalid Identifiers:**

```tc
let 9lives = 9 // Starts with a number
let my-var = 10 // Contains a special character
let for = "loop" // Reserved keyword
```

Note that Type-C is case-sensitive, which means `myVar` and `myvar`
would be considered different identifiers.

### Naming Conventions

In Type-C, clear and consistent naming conventions are essential for
code readability and maintenance. The following conventions are
established:

-   **Variables:** Employ camelCase for variable names. For instance,
`localVariable`.
-   **Constants:** Use uppercase with underscores for constants,
typically global compile-time constants. Example: `MAX_SIZE`.
-   **Methods:** Adopt camelCase for method names. When a method is
overloaded for different types, use an underscore to separate the
method name from the type descriptor, then continue in camelCase.
For general methods: `calculateTotal()`, and for type-specific
methods: `add_u8()`, `add_u16()`, `add_Object()`.
-   **Types:** Utilize PascalCase for type names. For example,
`UserDetails`. This is important especially for algebraic types
(variants), which when used with pattern matching, a capital letter symbol will match to a datatype.
-   **Modules and Packages:** Maintain lowercase letters and concatenate
words. For example, `networkutils`.

## Keywords

The following words are reserved keywords in Type-C and cannot be used
as identifiers: `as`, `as?`, `as!`, `await`, `break`, `extern`, `this`,
`class`, `continue`, `const`, `variant`, `do`, `else`, `extern`, `mut`,
`enum`, `false`, `from`, `for`, `foreach`, `fn`, `if`, `import`, `in`,
`is`, `interface`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`,
`f32`, `f64`, `bool`, `void`, `string`, `char`, `process`, `spawn`,
`let`, `new`, `null`, `return`, `this`, `static`, `strict`, `struct`,
`match`, `true`, `type`, `while`.

## Punctuation

Type-C doesn't require semicolons. The compiler will complain if it find
a semi-colon unless it is part of the grammar, in cases such as for
loops.

## Operators and Symbols

In Type-C, operators are fundamental constructs that perform various
types of operations on variables and values. Symbols, on the other hand,
serve as special characters that are part of the language's syntax.
Below, we categorize and describe these elements.

### Arithmetic Operators
-   `+` Addition
-   `-` Subtraction
-   `*` Multiplication
-   `/` Division
-   `%` Modulus

### Comparison Operators

-   `==` Equal to
-   `!=` Not equal to
-   `<` Less than
-   `<=` Less than or equal to
-   `>` Greater than
-   `>=` Greater than or equal to

### Logical Operators
-   `&&` Logical AND
-   `||` Logical OR
-   `!` Logical NOT

### Bitwise Operators

-   `&` Bitwise AND
-   `|` Bitwise OR
-   `^` Bitwise XOR
-   `<<` Bitwise left shift
-   `>>` Bitwise right shift
-   `~` Bitwise NOT

### Assignment Operators

-   `=` Assignment
-   `+=` Add and assign
-   `-=` Subtract and assign
-   `*=` Multiply and assign
-   `/=` Divide and assign

### Keyword Operators

-   `spawn` Spawning a process
-   `await` Await a Promise
-   `new` Class/Process allocator and consturctor
-   `is` Type checking
-   `as` Type casting

### Other Operators

-   `!` Denull operator, returns a non-nullable version of a nullable
type.
-   `?.` Nullable member access operator.
-   `++` Increment
-   `--` Decrement

### Special Symbols

-   `;`, `:`, `,`, `.`, `...`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}` Punctuation
and delimiters

-   `=>` Arrow for pattern matching
-   `->` Arrow used in type signatures
-   `_` Underscore, used in pattern matching (wild card) and as a
discard symbol

As for whitespace, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters, are
used to separate tokens and are generally ignored by the compiler. A
practice in type-c is to use whitespaces instead of tabs, 4 whitespaces
is the recommended value of indentation.

## Comments

Comments in type-c follows same rules as C-family language like Java, C
and C++. They come in two types:

-   Single line comments: They start with `//` and spans for the rest of
the line.

-   Multi-line comments: They start with two characters `/*` and end at
the very first occurrence of the enclosing comments `*/`. Multiline
comments cannot be nested.

Additionally, comments are a robust source of documentation if used
properly. Even though Type-C currently lacks a Doxygen-style parser for
automated documentation, a standard commenting style for code
documentation is encouraged. This helps in maintaining readability and
lays the foundation for future automated documentation parsing. The
recommended style is as follows:
```tc
/**
 * @brief: A short description of the function's purpose.
 * @param x: Description of the parameter x.
 * @return: What the function returns.
 */
```

**Example:**

```tc
/**
 * @brief: Computes the factorial of a given number.
 * @param x: The integer input for which factorial is computed.
 * @return: Returns the factorial of the input as an integer.
 */
fn factorial(x: u32) -> u32 {
    if x == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return x * factorial(x - 1)
}
```


## Literals

Literals represent constant values such as numbers or strings. Strings
start with double quotes `"Hello, world!"` or a single quote
`'Hello, type-c!'`. Any string literal with a single quote and only one
character is considered a `char` type, e.g., `'c', 'r', '\n'`. The rest
are strings such as `"hello", "c"`. Escape characters in string and
character literals allow for the representation of special characters
within the text. The available escape characters are:

-   `\\` - Backslash
-   `\'` - Single quote
-   `\"` - Double quote
-   `\n` - Newline
-   `\t` - Horizontal tab
-   `\r` - Carriage return
-   `\xhh` - Byte by hexadecimal
-   `\uXXXX` - Unicode code point below 10000 hexadecimal
-   `\UXXXXXXXX` - Unicode code point where each X is a hexadecimal
digit
- `b"value"` - Byte string literal, array of `u8`

Numbers are divided into three categories: single-precision
floating-point numbers, double-precision floating-point numbers, and
decimals. A single-precision float is a number that may or may not
include a floating point but ends with `f`, such as `3.14f` or `42f`. A
double float is a float that doesn't have a suffix, for example, `42.2`.
The overall regular expression for matching floats is:
`[+|-]?(?:[0-9]*)(?:\.[0-9]+)(?:[e|E]-[0-9]+)?f?`. A regular decimal
would be represented through simple numbers like `42`. It's possible to
write numbers not only in decimal but also in binary, octal, and
hexadecimal. Binary values are prefixed with `0b`, such as `0b0010`.
Octal numbers are prefixed with `0o`, and hexadecimal numbers are
prefixed with `0x`. Note that the prefix is case-sensitive for all these
cases.


|**Regex**|           **Semantic**|        **Example**|
|---------|-----------------------|-------------------|
|      `0b[0-1]+`      |Base 2 (Bin) numeric     |`0b1001`|
|      `0o[0-7]+`      |Base 8 (Oct) numeric     |`0o5647`|
|    `[0-9]+`     |Base 10 (Dec) numeric    |`5464987`|
|`0x[0-9a-fA-F]+`   |Base 16 (Hex) numeric   |`0xffeEA3`|


On the other hand, boolean literals are represented by the reserved
keywords `true` and `false`. They are of type `bool` and can take on
only these two values. `null` is also a literal (and a type!). Null can
only be assigned to memory referenced objects, i.e structs and objects.

## Program Structure

A standard type-c program is generally organized into several key
components. The structure ensures clean code separation and easier
module integration. Here's what to expect in a typical file:

1.  **Module Imports**: This is always the starting point of any type-c
file. Importing modules must be the first action. While not
mandatory, if present, must exclusively occupy the beginning of a
type-c file.

2.  **Type Declarations**: Unlike some languages that allow inline type
declarations, type-c insists on global type declarations. This
architectural choice facilitates easy type imports across different
modules.

3.  **Function Declarations**: This section is devoted to defining
functions. Note that only named functions are considered here, as
anonymous functions and lambda expressions are technically treated
as variables.

4.  **Global Variables**: While they are often considered harmful,
global variables are allowed. However, it's strongly recommended to
limit their mutability. Your code, your rules, but you've been
warned.

This overview serves as a blueprint. Each of these components will be
dissected and discussed in the following sections.

## Importing Modules

The first logical step in most programs is to import modules. Type-C
treats folders and files as modules, emphasizing the need for coherent
naming and structuring of your files. Unlike some other languages,
you're only allowed to import modules at the beginning of your file;
once you declare a variable, function, or type, you can no longer
perform imports. For instance, from our hello world example, the default
package, `std`, is a folder containing various files such as `io.tc`.
It's essential to note that nested imports don't propagate. If program A
imports library B, which in turn imports library C, library C is not
implicitly imported into A.

```tc
// fn someX() -> X
import someX from xfile

let x = someX()
// This will compile as the compiler knows the type X
print;n(x.value)
// The following line won't compile as the type X isn't imported
let y: X = someX()
```

You can import datatypes and functions. Global variables are not allowed.
```tc
// import .. as
import std.io as inputOutput

// from .. import as
from std.io import print as printPlease

// from .. import *
from std.io import *

// import *
import std.io.*

// multiple imports
from std.io import print, printf as printFmt
```

## Variable Declarations:

### Basic Declarations

In Type-C, variables must be explicitly typed unless they can be inferred from the context. Here's a basic example:

```tc
let x: u32 = 1
```

Type inference isn't automatic for literals, so either the type must be explicitly declared, or the value must be cast:

```tc
let x = 1 as u32
let y = u32(1)
```

Casting as a function call, like `u32(1)`, is permitted only for basic data types. This feature simplifies working with literals and type conversions.

### Multiple Declarations

Multiple variables can be declared in a single statement, which can be useful for code organization:

```
let x: u32 = 1, y: u32 = 2
```

### Immutability

Immutability is enforced using the `const` keyword:

```tc
let const z: u8 = 1
```

Once declared as immutable, the variable can't be reassigned:

```tc
z = 2 // Compile-time error
```

Note that if you're declaring multiple variables as immutable in a single statement, each variable must be explicitly marked with `const`.

### Nested Declarations

Type-C supports scoping within expressions using nested `let` declarations:

```tc
let a: u32 =
    let b = x + y in
        b * z
```

Variables declared within the inner `let` are only available inside its scope, which allows for cleaner, functional-style programming.

### Destructuring

Destructuring is a feature that allows unpacking arrays or structs into individual variables:

```tc
let myArray: u8[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
let [x, y, z, ...rest] = myArray
```
It's important to note that the compiler does not check if the size of the array matches the number of variables you are
trying to destructure into. This check is performed at runtime, and a runtime error (Invalid Index) will occur if
the sizes do not match. Therefore, it's the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the destructuring is valid given
the size of the array. Destructuring feature works for structs as well, making it highly versatile:

```tc
type RandomStruct = struct {x: u32, y: u32, z: u32}
let structValue: RandomStruct = {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}
let {x, ...rest} = structValue
```

### Immutability Consequences

Immutable variables are 'read-only', their state and the states of their components can't be modified:

```tc
type User = class {
    let name: string
    let age: u32

    fn init(name: string, age: u32) {
        this += {name, age}
    }

    fn setAge(newAge: u32) = this.age = age
}

let const user = new User("Hannibal", 35)
user.setAge(35) // Compile-time error
```

Immutable variables are restrictive but secure. Using them in a function where mutability is expected will result in a
compile-time error. Note that type-c doesn't enforce deep immutability, meaning if an immutable variable `x` for example,
holds a reference to another object `y`, which is also referenced by a mutable variable `z`, the state of `x` can still
be altered if `z` was to change. Immutability is enforced from the root object, but not recursively.

## Function Declarations

Functions in Type-C are defined using the `fn` keyword, followed by the function name and its parameters. Once declared, these functions are immutable, meaning they can't be reassigned.

```tc
fn main(args: string[]) -> void {
    // do stuff
}
```

### Function Parameters and Return Types

By default, function arguments are immutable because Type-C encourages functional purity. Attempting to modify an argument without explicitly declaring it mutable with the `mut` keyword will result in a compile-time error. The return type of a function is denoted by the `->` symbol.

```tc
fn multiply(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    return x * y
}

fn changeArg(mut x: u32) -> void {
    x = 3
}
```

### Expression Bodies

Functions can be defined with an expression body, providing a concise way to define simple functions. The return type is
optional and is inferred if not provided.

```tc
fn multiply(x: u32, y: u32) = x * y
```

Also, if a function has a block-body and no return type, it is presumed to return `void` by default.


### Generic Functions

Functions can also be defined as generic, parameterized over types. Type checking is deferred until the generic types
are concretized. Note that generic functions can't be passed as arguments or invoked unless their type parameters are
explicitly specified.

```tc
fn multiply<T>(x: T, y: T) -> T = x * y

let x = multiply<u32>(3, 3)

fn apply(f: fn(f32, f32) -> u32, x, y) =
    f(x, y)

let y = apply(multiply<f32>, f32(x), 0.13f)

let z = multiply<string>("hello", "world") // <- compiler error!
```
