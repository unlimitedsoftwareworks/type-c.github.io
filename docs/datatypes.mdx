# Data Types
In this section, we will discuss the various data types supported by Type-C. The language provides a set of built-in types, as well as the ability to define custom types.

Type-C offers the following datatypes:
- [Primitive Types](/datatypes/basictypes): Basic types such as `bool`, `u32`, `f64`, etc.
- [Structs](/datatypes/structs): Structured types that group together other types.
- [Enums](/datatypes/enums): Enumerated types that can hold one of several values.
- [Variants](/datatypes/variants): Variants, also known as algebraic data types, that can hold one of several types, with constructors.
- [Arrays](/datatypes/arrays): Arrays, a collection of elements of the same type.
- [Functions](/datatypes/functions): Functions as data types, since Type-C supports first-class functions, functions need to be typed as well.
- [Interfaces](/datatypes/interfaces): Interfaces, the basic building blocks of interface-oriented programming in type-c. Defines a set of methods that a class must implement.
- [Classes](/datatypes/classes): Classes, a subset of object-oriented programming in type-c.
- [Processes](/datatypes/processes): Data type to build concurrent programs in type-c.
- [Nullables](/datatypes/nullables): Nullables, a type that can hold either a value or null.
